I am currently a third-year undergraduate student majoring in Artificial Intelligence at the School of Future Technology, South China University of Technology. My research interests lie in 3D object detection, semantic scene understanding, and cross-modal representation learning. Recently I'm diving into efficient perception algorithms and multi-modal learning frameworks for intelligent systems.

Feel free to reach out if you are interested in collaboration or have any questions.

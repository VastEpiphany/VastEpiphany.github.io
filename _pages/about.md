I am currently a third-year undergraduate student majoring in Artificial Intelligence at the [School of Future Technology](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/ft/), [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/). My research interests lie in 3D object detection, semantic scene understanding, and cross-modal representation learning. Recently I'm diving into efficient perception algorithms and multi-modal learning frameworks for intelligent systems.

Feel free to reach out if you are interested in collaboration or have any questions.

Developed and compared three deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms—Deep Q-Network (DQN), Deep SARSA, and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)—to solve the LunarLander-v2 environment from OpenAI Gym. Systematically tuned hyperparameters such as learning rate, exploration rate, and clipping threshold to optimize performance. The PPO algorithm demonstrated superior stability and efficiency, achieving an average score of 280 over 100 consecutive test episodes, surpassing the 200-point success threshold. DQN variants reached the target score within 400–500 episodes, while optimized Deep SARSA achieved a stable average reward of 270 after 800 episodes. The experimental results highlight the effectiveness of PPO in balancing fast convergence and policy stability in high-dimensional continuous control tasks.

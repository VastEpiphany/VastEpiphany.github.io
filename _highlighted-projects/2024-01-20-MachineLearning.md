In our work, we focus on advanced data preprocessing and predictive modeling to enhance quantitative trading
 efficiency. We detail essential steps like <strong>data reading, type
 conversion, handling of NaN values, standardization, and trans
formations specific to minute-level data, emphasizing consistency
 in data management</strong>. Our evaluation of various predictive models,
 such as <strong>Random Forest, GRU and LSTM, A2C and PPO,
 and AutoGluon</strong>, highlights their effectiveness in regression, time
 series analysis, and trading decision optimization. We discuss
 investment strategies that integrate daily and intraday data with
 technical indicators and risk management principles. Finally, our
 creation of a quantitative trading investment portfolio based on
 key Hang Seng Index stocks, analyzed using advanced tools,
 showcases the integration of comprehensive data processing and
 predictive modeling in enhancing trading decision-making and
 efficiency.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Developed "HearMeGLM", a role-playing psychological counseling large language model, to address the growing demand for accessible mental health support in the post-pandemic era. Fine-tuned the ChatGLM3-6B base model using a curated dataset of over 4,385 dialogue samples via the LLaMA-Factory framework and LoRA method, enhancing its ability to provide empathetic, professional, and human-like responses. The fine-tuned model demonstrated significant performance improvements, achieving a 48.08% increase in BLEU-4 score (from 7.59 to 11.24) and a 40.3% reduction in inference time (from 12m44s to 7m36s), while also scoring higher in comprehension, professionalism, and authenticity when evaluated by GPT-4o on semantic content metrics.

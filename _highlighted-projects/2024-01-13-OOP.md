<p style="text-align: justify;">
Our Social Club is a <strong>Python-based</strong> student community interaction system designed to enhance cross-grade communication and information sharing within a university setting. 
It provides a unified platform that integrates multiple functions, including <strong>user registration and authentication, friend management, bulletin boards, suggestion boxes, file sharing, recruitment information, reward task boards, and a lost-and-found module</strong>. 
By combining these features into a centralized, user-friendly GUI built with Tkinter and ttkbootstrap while employing the concept of Object Oriented Programming, the system promotes collaboration, improves the efficiency of information dissemination, and strengthens student engagement in both academic and social activities.
